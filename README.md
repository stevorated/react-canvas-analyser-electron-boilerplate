An Example of a simple audio handler (AudioContext API) with canvas drawing capability
it can be used to show a frequency or/and sinewave display

**to run**

git clone
yarn
yarn dev // to run in development environment with hmr on the react side
or
yarn start // to run without hmr (use NODE_ENV to determine env)
or
yarn build to build the app

the react side should work on every web based browser/platform
to use with electron change paths and DESKTOP_PATH to a valid path in your pc
to use with urls just insert them (component uses axios to access file)
